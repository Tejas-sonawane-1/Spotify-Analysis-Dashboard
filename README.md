# 🎵 Spotify Analysis Dashboard | Power BI Project

## 📘 Project Overview
This project dives deep into the world of **Spotify data** — transforming raw numbers about songs, artists, and albums into meaningful insights using **Power BI**.  
The goal was to explore **how music trends evolve**, which artists dominate the charts, and how song popularity changes over time.  

It’s not just a dashboard — it’s a data-driven story about music, creativity, and analytics. 🎧✨

## 🎯 Problem Statement

- Who are the most active and popular artists?
- What kind of songs perform best (explicit vs non-explicit)?

This project solves that by creating **a clear, interactive dashboard** that answers these questions visually.
